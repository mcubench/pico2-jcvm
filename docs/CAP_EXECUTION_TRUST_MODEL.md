# CAP execution trust model

CAPs installed through GlobalPlatform are untrusted executable input, even
when the installer authenticated the LOAD/INSTALL exchange. A valid CAP parser
result establishes structural validity only; it does not authorize VM-internal
instructions or prove bytecode control flow safe.

Firmware ROM-mask packages are trusted. The card manager allocates every
dynamically uploaded CAP package in IDs 56 through 63. `impdep1` is reserved
for ROM bytecode that invokes native Java Card API dispatch. It must never
dispatch an applet-supplied native method index. The VM therefore rejects
`impdep1` and `impdep2` while the current executing package is dynamically
allocated.

This is one boundary only. It does not certify instruction fetches, method
headers, branch targets, constant-pool linkage, or heap field types. Those
checks remain required before claiming safe execution of malformed or hostile
CAP programs. Valid upstream CAPs remain the compatibility baseline.
