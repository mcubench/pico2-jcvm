## 2026-10-09 — Development environment diagnostics

- Step/experiment: `wp1-host-diagnostics`
- Change: Added `tools/doctor` to report host tools, Pico SDK configuration, and required CHOUPI dependency checkouts. Added session continuity instructions and a handoff record because the required continuity file was absent.
- Validation: `bash -n tools/doctor` passed. `./tools/doctor` returned 1 as expected and identified missing `cmake`, `cargo`, `rustc`, `PICO_SDK_PATH`, and the OS/API/rommask dependency sources; it did not attempt hardware access.
- Result: The checkout inspection found the C++ VM and AlgTest source, but its OS/API/rommask dependencies are empty; GitHub access and the local embedded build toolchain are unavailable.
- Decision: Preserve supplied source trees; proceed with VM-only changes where safe, then populate pinned dependencies and establish the host baseline before hardware port validation.
- Commit: `1616b59`
- Artifacts/logs: `.agent/HANDOFF.md`; no hardware log
