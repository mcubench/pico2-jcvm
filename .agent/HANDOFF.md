# Handoff

## Objective

Implement `plan.md` for CHOUPI on Pico 2, following root `AGENTS.md`. The user
has connected the Pico 2 and requested real-board bring-up. Use JCAlgTest
v1.8.2 and preserve the provided source trees.

## Current state

- The root repository tracks only the plan and RP2350 references at the
  starting revision. `choupi/` and `AlgTest_JavaCard/` are user-provided,
  untracked source trees; preserve them and commit only files belonging to a
  completed step.
- The CHOUPI C++ VM source is present. `choupi/os/`,
  `choupi/javacard-sdk/javacard-api/`, and
  `choupi/javacard-sdk/rommask/` are empty dependency directories, despite
  their entries in `choupi/.gitmodules`.
- The user selected JCAlgTest v1.8.2. `AlgTest_JavaCard/src305` identifies
  itself as v1.8.2 and the matching `AlgTest_v1.8.2_jc305.cap` is present.
  CAP import metadata still needs comparison with the ROM mask.
- A repository-local toolchain is installed under `.local-toolchain/`; use
  `./tools/env <command>` to select it. It includes CMake/Ninja, ARM and
  RISC-V compilers, stable Rust with the Cortex-M33 target, Pico SDK 2.3.1,
  pioasm, and picotool. See `.agent/TOOLCHAIN.md` for versions and hashes.
  Setup and the hardware report are committed as `db99639`.
- The board is visible in BOOTSEL mode. Read-only `picotool info -a` reported
  RP2350 A4, QFN60, 2048 KiB flash, and an existing RISC-V image named
  `pico2_btc_miner`. Before flashing, saved a read-only 2 MiB backup at
  `artifacts/backups/flash-before-smoke-20261010.bin`, SHA-256
  `49a650c2093df2e2d528ec4ef9adce788db95133c7303b5f96d852d8b5ecc078`.
  Flash size remains a device report pending independent physical confirmation.
- Added the root Pico SDK smoke target and `tools/build`, `tools/cycle`, and
  `tools/monitor`. The final `./tools/env ./tools/cycle arm` passed: both ARM
  and RISC-V built with warnings as errors, picotool reported the expected UF2
  families, and the board emitted repeated `TEST:PASS random_stream_varies`
  and `TEST:SUMMARY pass=1 fail=0` records during the bounded 8-second serial
  capture. The board currently runs this ARM smoke firmware. This check only
  confirms changing output from `get_rand_32()`; it does not assess entropy or
  execute CHOUPI. Final log: `artifacts/logs/cycle-arm-20261010T053019Z.log`.
  Implementation commit: `9bd89df`.
- `tools/doctor` finds the host toolchain through `./tools/env` but still fails
  on unpopulated CHOUPI OS/API/ROM-mask dependencies. The root smoke CMake
  target and `tools/build`, `tools/common.sh`, `tools/cycle`, and `tools/monitor`
  are now present and have passed the hardware smoke cycle.
- Diagnostics and continuity setup are committed as `1616b59`.
- Fixed `JCVMArray::fill()` to populate each element and removed the ignored
  return qualifier from `size()`. The focused strict host test passed with
  `TEST:PASS jcvmarray_fill`; committed as `0d293ae`.
- Implemented the `putstatic_a` path and nested persistent reference-array
  element tags in the VM persistence layer. Syntax checks passed using a
  temporary variadic `ffi.h` shim; this does not prove ABI compatibility or
  runtime persistence behavior. The step is committed as `ab1957b`; see the
  latest progress entry.
- Added guards for transient/non-reference persistent arrays and index bounds
  in the child-reference writer. Its syntax check and the JCVM array test both
  pass; runtime persistence has not been verified. Commit: `7e04f97`.
- Implemented Java-object `athrow` table dispatch across current and caller
  frames, saving each frame's opcode address and restoring package context as
  frames unwind. Syntax checks pass, but no runtime tests are possible yet;
  native `Exceptions` mapping and uncaught status-word handling are still open.
  Commit: `476a938`.
- Fixed the typed class/interface matcher to return `FALSE` on non-match; the
  expanded syntax check passes. CAP hierarchy runtime tests remain pending.
  Commit: `6f7f1bc`.
- Implemented the object-deletion capability fallback natives (`FALSE` and
  no-op). Syntax check passes; target builds and runtime native dispatch tests
  remain unavailable. Commit: `512337f`.
- Repaired persistent instance class/tag handling and reference-field get/set.
  Syntax checks pass, but `JC_Instance::getFields()` still cannot reconstruct
  a persistent object's typed field vector; this remains open for WP5. Commit:
  `a740f5e`.
- Fixed persistent instance class-index initialization and reference get/set
  behavior. Syntax passes; filesystem round-trip behavior is not validated.
  Commit: `a05147e`.
- Persistent instances now retain their original filesystem tag separately
  from their field storage, and `getFields()` lazily rebuilds typed field
  values, including split-word ints and reference/array values. Setters also
  keep cached field types and values aligned with serialized records. Syntax
  and the array regression test pass. No persistence round-trip test is
  possible without the filesystem implementation; missing child records still
  cannot be typed from the current class metadata API. Commit: `5263602`.
- The interpreter no longer spins forever after a VM-internal exception.
  `run()` returns `0x6F00` on an uncaught VM exception, including an `athrow`
  with no matching handler, and the C runtime entry returns that status. This
  still does not map VM exceptions to Java objects or send a status over APDU.
  Commit: `ff6a4b8`.
- The `JCSystem` transaction information natives report zero active depth and
  zero commit capacity, matching the runtime's lack of transaction support.
  AlgTest's system-information path queries maximum commit capacity. Mutating
  transaction calls remain unimplemented. Syntax and array regression checks
  pass; target builds remain unavailable. Commit: `53660ca`.
- Fixed `JCVMArray` ownership semantics for mutable copies and moves while
  preserving non-owning read-only CAP views. `JC_Array` now lets its backing
  buffer owner free storage exactly once, allocates the full tagged persistent
  array payload, reports transient element counts correctly, and recognizes
  `CLEAR_ON_RESET`. Focused copy/move and transient-size tests pass; the latter
  uses AddressSanitizer with leak detection disabled due an environment-level
  LeakSanitizer failure. Commit: `6fa7232`.
- Added an RAII active-context binding around interpreter execution, implemented
  `isTransient`, and implemented primitive transient boolean, byte, short, and
  int array factories. Invalid lengths and clear events map to the specified VM
  exceptions. Syntax and array tests pass; target builds remain unavailable.
  Object transient arrays still lack reference-type metadata in their native
  signature, and actual reset/deselect clearing awaits lifecycle hooks. Commit:
  `e56d14f`.
- Added `JC_Array::clearTransientData()` and `Heap::clearTransientArrays(event)`;
  the heap clears only transient arrays registered for the requested event. A
  focused ASan test verifies reset and deselect selection. The clear primitive
  is not yet called by lifecycle dispatch because that dispatch does not exist.
  Commit: `6d3630e`.
- Implemented native primitive array copy for `arrayCopyRepack` and its
  non-atomic counterpart. The path checks ranges and matching array types and
  snapshots input to preserve overlap semantics. Focused ASan tests cover an
  overlapping byte copy plus bounds/type errors. Reference copying remains
  unsupported; transaction atomicity is unavailable. Commit: `8e92ec1`.
- Implemented `arrayCompareGeneric` for byte arrays with range checks, signed
  Java byte comparison, and ternary results. The focused ASan test covers equality,
  signed-byte boundary ordering, and normal less-than ordering. SensitiveResult
  tracking is not implemented. Commit: `92ef957`. A follow-up checked the
  Java Card primitive ordering and corrected the comparison to signed bytes;
  that correction is committed as `e088119`.
- Implemented byte `arrayFillGeneric` and its non-atomic counterpart. The
  helper repeats bytes from the supplied pattern offset and returns the target
  end offset. A focused ASan test covers repetition; compatibility with the
  missing Java Card SDK binding has not been verified. Commit: `bb5d2b8`.
- Expanded the host native test to call the transient byte-array factory,
  `isTransient`, and invalid length/event paths using a live `Context`. The
  linked ASan test passes, closing the earlier native runtime-test gap for
  these paths. Java exception dispatch and actual card lifecycle events remain
  untested. Commit: `64fe919`.
- Expanded factory coverage to boolean, byte, short, and int arrays, including
  both valid clear events and `isTransient(null)`. All pass in the linked ASan
  host test. Object array creation remains unsupported. Commit: `bacd8fc`.
- Implemented `selectingApplet()` as `FALSE` in the current runtime because it
  has no applet selection or pending-select state. The linked ASan test passes;
  this must become stateful with lifecycle dispatch. Commit: `3446422`.
- Implemented `getAssignedChannel()` as channel 0 for the single-channel
  transport. The linked ASan test verifies it; logical channels are not
  supported. Commit: `657e589`.
- Implemented the SensitiveArrays integrity-array capability probe as
  `FALSE`, matching the absence of integrity storage and verification in this
  runtime. The linked ASan test now checks the capability result; operations
  that require integrity arrays remain unsupported. Commit: `32c88dd`.
- Implemented `isIntegritySensitive(Object)` as `FALSE` for non-null objects
  and `NullPointerException` for null, since this runtime never creates or
  tracks sensitive arrays. Focused host tests cover both cases; commit:
  `3ef6da7`.
- The documentation finalization commit `bff7c23` accidentally included 63
  previously untracked provided source files from stale index entries. Their
  worktree copies were hash-verified and retained; corrective commit `ae783a2`
  removes them from the index again. Keep the provided source trees untracked.
- The requested `.agent/SESSION_CONTINUITY.md` was absent and has now been
  created. Root `progress.md` will be append-only.

## Next action

Continue WP5 by mapping the remaining native methods against the supplied
AlgTest calls and available VM APIs. Wire the transient clear primitive into
select/deselect/reset dispatch when that lifecycle layer is introduced.
VM-internal exception
mapping and the Java API/APDU pieces remain open. The standalone RP2350 build
wrappers and hardware smoke cycle now work. Next, populate or otherwise resolve
the pinned Java Card dependencies (`654f374`, `ac9f752`, `d490faf`) and integrate
CHOUPI with the Pico SDK target. The OS, Java Card API, and ROM-mask submodule
directories are currently empty, so the standalone smoke image is not a CHOUPI
or JCAlgTest runtime. Preserve the local `.local-toolchain/`,
`AlgTest_JavaCard/`, and CHOUPI source tree.

## Latest validation

- Current board bring-up: `bash -n tools/common.sh tools/build tools/cycle
  tools/monitor`, ARM build, RISC-V build, and `./tools/env ./tools/cycle arm`
  all passed. The 8-second capture emitted repeated
  `TEST:PASS random_stream_varies` and `TEST:SUMMARY pass=1 fail=0`; log:
  `artifacts/logs/cycle-arm-20261010T053019Z.log`.
- `bash -n tools/doctor`: passed.
- `./tools/doctor`: returned 1 and reported the missing tools, SDK variable,
  and dependency checkout paths listed in `progress.md`.
- Latest VM syntax check: `TEST:PASS vm_core_syntax`; existing upstream
  warnings remain.
- Latest `./tools/test-jcvmarray`: `TEST:PASS jcvmarray_fill`.
- `./tools/build arm` and `./tools/build riscv`: wrapper absent; both calls
  returned status 127.
- Latest interpreter exception/status step: `./tools/check-vm-syntax` passed
  with `TEST:PASS vm_core_syntax`; `./tools/test-jcvmarray` passed.
- Latest array storage step: `./tools/test-jcvmarray` passed its fill and
  copy/move checks; `./tools/test-jcarray` passed `TEST:PASS
  jcarray_transient_size` under AddressSanitizer (LeakSanitizer disabled).
- Latest active-context/transient-native step: `./tools/check-vm-syntax`,
  `./tools/test-jcvmarray`, and `./tools/test-jcarray` passed; both target build
  wrapper calls returned 127 because `tools/build` is absent.
- Latest transient-clear primitive step: `./tools/test-jcarray` passed both
  `jcarray_transient_size` and `jcarray_clear_events`; syntax and JCVM array
  tests passed; both target build wrapper calls returned 127.
- Latest native array-copy step: focused ASan tests passed overlap and error
  cases; syntax and JCVM array tests passed; both target build calls returned
  127 because the wrapper is absent.
- Latest native array-compare step: focused ASan comparison checks, including
  signed byte ordering, passed; syntax checks passed; target build wrappers
  returned 127 because the wrapper is absent.
- Latest native array-fill step: focused ASan pattern repetition, syntax checks
  passed; ARM/RISC-V build wrappers returned 127 because the wrapper is absent.
- Latest transient-native runtime test: linked ASan test exercised factory,
  `isTransient`, and invalid argument paths; syntax checks passed. Target build
  wrappers were not rerun because only test files changed.
- Latest primitive-factory coverage: linked ASan test passed all four primitive
  array types and null handling; only test code changed.
- Latest selecting-applet fallback: linked ASan test and syntax check passed;
  ARM and RISC-V build wrappers remain absent.
- Latest basic-channel fallback: linked ASan test and syntax check passed;
  ARM and RISC-V build wrappers remain absent.
- Latest integrity-array capability fallback: linked ASan test passed and
  emitted `TEST:PASS jni_integrity_arrays_capability`; syntax check passed.
  ARM and RISC-V builds could not run because `tools/build` is absent.
- Latest integrity-sensitive query: linked ASan test passed and emitted
  `TEST:PASS jni_integrity_sensitive_query`; syntax check passed. ARM and
  RISC-V builds could not run because `tools/build` is absent.
- Firmware runtime validation is still pending for CHOUPI: the connected board
  runs the standalone smoke firmware and its bounded USB serial test passed.
- Toolchain setup: `bash -n tools/env` passed. `./tools/env rustup target
  list --installed` includes `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf`; CMake/Ninja, both
  compiler prefixes, and picotool version checks passed. `./tools/env
  ./tools/doctor` reports the host tools and Pico SDK as present, but exits 1
  for the missing OS/API/ROM-mask dependencies. The root smoke build wrappers
  now pass for both ISAs. Board queries and cycles required reviewed escalation.
